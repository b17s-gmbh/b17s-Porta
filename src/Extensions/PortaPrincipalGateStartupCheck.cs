/// <summary>
/// Surfaces the silent authentication gap at startup: a Porta endpoint that requires an authenticated
/// principal (it stamps <c>RequireAuthorization()</c>) while <b>no</b> ASP.NET Core authentication
/// scheme is registered to populate <see cref="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext.User"/>. In that
/// configuration every such endpoint rejects every request with <c>401</c> before the pipeline runs -
/// a surprising failure that the per-endpoint metadata makes detectable here.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This logs at <see cref="LogLevel.Critical"/> rather than throwing: an endpoint that authenticates
/// via an in-pipeline <c>IAuthenticationProvider</c> and is correctly marked <c>.AllowAnonymous()</c>
/// stamps "does not require a principal" and is not counted, so the check is precise - but a consumer
/// may still have an intentional reason for a scheme-less host, and failing the boot outright would be
/// heavier-handed than the fail-fast HttpClient/HA checks that guard unambiguous misconfigurations.
/// <para/>
/// This is deliberately a coarse smoke check: it asserts only that <em>some</em> scheme exists, not
/// that a scheme is actually wired to authenticate the gated endpoints. A misrouted multi-scheme setup
/// (e.g. the gated endpoints forward to a scheme that never populates the principal) still passes. It
/// catches the common "no scheme registered at all" mistake, not every authentication misconfiguration.
